# Football World Cup Score Board 

The project has been developed as a result of participating in SportsRadar coding challenge. Its purpose is to return live scores ordered by number of goals and if that number happens to be the same - by the time of adding the match into the system. Finished matches go out of the board. 

### Notice

-`getLiveScoreBoard`: returns all the matches that are in progress along with their scores, order by total goals count first, then - time the match was added to the system.
